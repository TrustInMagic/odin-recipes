      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion (180g), finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 yellow pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>115g brown basmati rice</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a <strong>large</strong> pan set over a high heat and fry the onion, celery and pepper, stirring occasionally, for 5 mins until starting to soften and colour.</li>
        <li>Stir in the spices and rice, then tip in the tomatoes and a can of water. Stir in the garlic, beans and bouillon. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 25 mins until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. </li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the pan towards the end of the cooking time to make sure it doesn’t boil dry – if it starts to catch, add a little more water. Stir in the parsley and serve hot.</li>
      </ol>
